# Neural-Networks
This is my work and understanding of Andrej Karpathy's online course on Neural Networks: Zero to Hero.
This is the basics of backpropagation and build-up to modern deep neural networks, like GPT.
I wanted to learn language models because its a great way to learn deep learning since most of it is transferable.
